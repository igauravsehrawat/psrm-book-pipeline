Depending on the specific mechanisms used, a UUID is either guaranteed to be different or is, at least, extremely likely to be different from any other UUID generated until 3400 A.D. The UUID relies upon a combination of components to ensure uniqueness. A guaranteed UUID contains a reference to the network address of the host that generated the UUID, a timestamp (a record of the precise time of a transaction), and a randomly generated component. Because the network address identifies a unique computer, and the timestamp is unique for each UUID generated from a particular host, those two components should sufficiently ensure uniqueness. However, the randomly generated element of the UUID is added as a protection against any unforseeable problem.</p></div><div><br></div><div>Refer this for more generic Information: <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier" class="" title="">UUID WIKI INFO</a></strong></div><div><b>Applications:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_42_0/libs/uuid/uuid.html" class="" title="">BOOST: UUID</a></b></div><div><br></div><div><strong>How unique is UUID ?</strong></div><div>---------------------------------</div><div><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1155008/how-unique-is-uuid" class="" title=""><strong>REFER STACKOVERFLOW Expert's ANSWER</strong></a></div><div><br></div><div><b>UUID Algorithm Analysis</b></div><div>---------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Most of the time, many things need to be shared but should be unique enough to be confined within a sender and a receiver. All of the social networking and sharing sites need to have a unique URI/URN which ensures privacy to the user. UUID is what emerges to compliant with that very huge need to generate an all-time UNIQUE string.</div><div><em><strong>Dropbox, Google drive, Evernote, Microsoft(GUID)</strong></em> and many other big and famous organizations are using it(derived their own versions).<b> Even this book editor uses a UUID version 4 as I saw it when I was editing in its editor. This editor allows collaboration just because of this UUID concept where a UNIQUE URL is generated, more precisely a UNIQUE path locator, which is the core of collaborating web-apps</b></div><div><br></div><div>Full Official Specification&nbsp;<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4122.html" class="" title=""><b>RFC4122 UUID Reference</b></a><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><b>IDEA</b></div><div>--------</div><div><br></div><div>The idea behind the scene is to generate a uniquely identified string &nbsp;and is based on a very known fact that is to first find the things which are always changing i.e. have least/no probability of being duplicated/collided ever for example: a particular Time moment, or which relatively differs for example: MAC Address and on-the-fly generated random strings. All these stuff combined under one hood with much more security concerning factors ensures HOW UNIQUE IS UUID.</div><div><br></div><div style=""><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><p>UUIDs are of a fixed size (128 bits) which is reasonably small
   compared to other alternatives.  This lends itself well to sorting,
   ordering, and hashing of all sorts, storing in databases, simple
   allocation, and ease of programming in general.

   Since UUIDs are unique and persistent, they make excellent Uniform
   Resource Names.  The unique ability to generate a new UUID without a
   registration process allows for UUIDs to be one of the URNs with the
   lowest minting cost.</p></div><div style=""><ul><li>I think it was the need for the advancing technology to have something like it.</li></ul></div><div style=""><ul><li>Time based things are most probably UNIQUE unless generated concurrently at high speeds and distributed.</li></ul></div><div style=""><ul><li>Clock cycles are always distinguishable.</li></ul></div><div style=""><ul><li>Network MAC Address is also UNIQUE for a particular machine.</li></ul></div><div style=""><ul><li>Random stings(long alphanumerics) are what I consider unique for small purposes like CAPTCHA</li></ul></div><div style=""><ul><li style="">MD5, SHA1 cryptography algorithms, as used in Version 3, is what comes to my mind when I heard UUID. MD5 and SHA1 hashing is being used for long mostly in DB related stuff. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br style=""></li></ul></div><div><b>UUID has Variant and Versions:</b></div><div>-------------------------------------------------</div><div><b><u>Version 1</u></b> is the time based plus MAC address UUID. The 128-bits contains 48-bits for the network card's MAC address (which is uniquely assigned by the manufacturer) and a 60-bit clock with a resolution of 100 nanoseconds. That clock wraps in 3603 A.D. so these UUIDs are safe at least until then (unless you need more than 10 million new UUIDs per second or someone clones your network card).</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Version 4</u></b> is the random number UUID. There's six fixed bits and the rest of the UUID is 122-bits of randomness. See Wikipedia or other analysis that describe how very unlikely a duplicate is.</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Version 3</u></b> is uses MD5 and Version 5 uses SHA-1 to create those 122-bits, instead of a random or pseudo-random number generator. So in terms of safety it is like Version 4 being a statistical issue (as long as you make sure what the digest algorithm is processing is always unique).</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Version 2</u></b> is similar to Version 1, but with a smaller clock so it is going to wrap around much sooner. But since Version 2 UUIDs are for DCE, you shouldn't be using these.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Examples</b></div><div>---------------</div><div style=""><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><p><span class="c1"><b>// Generate a v1 (time-based) id</b></span></p></div><div style=""><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><pre><span class="c1">6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a</span></pre><b><span class="c1">// Generate a v4 (random) id</span></b></div><div style=""><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><pre><span class="c1">110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1</span></pre></div><div style=""><pre></pre>Version is embed in the string itself, its fourth char of the third byte, as <b><i><u>1 in 11e1 and 4 in 4ac4.</u></i></b></div><div style="">1=&gt; Version 1 and so on till 4.<figure class="figure" title=""><div class="title">UUID Structure</div><img draggable="false" src="http://dmatech.info/csdocs/sketch/csd990717-UUID-structure.gif" alt="UUID Structure"><figcaption>UUID structure</figcaption></figure></div><div><br></div>
