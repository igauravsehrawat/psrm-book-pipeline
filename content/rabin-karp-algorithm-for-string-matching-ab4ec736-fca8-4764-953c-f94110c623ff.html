    Algorithm Explanation</h1><p>Rabin-Karp is string matching algorithm. Rabin-Karp uses hashing to reduce the number of comparisons while matching a string.</p><p>Rabin-Karp hashes the string to be searched and target string into a sing number, using some mathematical function and than matches thus reducing the number of comparision as in case of brute force method.</p><p><br></p><h1>Probable reasons of Discovery of Algorithm</h1><p>I think in case of the Rabin-Karp Algorithm it is important to notice that it was an algorithm which might be discovered to improve complexity of already existing algorithm. So basic focus in discovery of Rabin-Karp algorithm might have been to reduce the number of comparison in the Brute Force method.</p><p>Initially the problem might be imagined for the numbers i.e. the string to be matched and the target string &nbsp;are numbers for e.g.</p><p>str1 = "1234"</p><p>str2 = "123456123489"</p><p>So now while comparing the two strings the number of comparisons will be reduced, as now str1 will now will be compared to sub-strings of str2 requiring only one comparison. This time we do not need to compare the strings character wise we can directly compare the numbers in one go.</p><p>Now this idea might have been extended for the cases where string contains alphabets and other special characters.</p><p>In the case 
<!--StartFragment--><span>where string contains alphabets one can map the alphabets to numbers following an one to one mapping. Now at this stage the next problem which might have&nbsp;occurred is that number of alphabets are more than 10 so they cannot be represented as decimal numbers. To avoid the problem the first idea which comes to mind is why not add the corresponding mapped number in string which represent the string this reduces number of comparisons. But this also has some problem as (3 + 2) is equal to (4 + 1). So to solve this, when the number representing str1 and sub-string of str2 (equal to length of str1) are equal then we can actually compare the original strings.</span></p><p>According to me this could have been the process in the discovery of Rabin-Karp, the actual scenerios might be totally different but this is what I think might be the process of discovery.</p>
