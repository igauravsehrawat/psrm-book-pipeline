Depending on the specific mechanisms used, a UUID is either guaranteed to be different or is, at least, extremely likely to be different from any other UUID generated until 3400 A.D. The UUID relies upon a combination of components to ensure uniqueness. A guaranteed UUID contains a reference to the network address of the host that generated the UUID, a timestamp (a record of the precise time of a transaction), and a randomly generated component. Because the network address identifies a unique computer, and the timestamp is unique for each UUID generated from a particular host, those two components should sufficiently ensure uniqueness. However, the randomly generated element of the UUID is added as a protection against any unforseeable problem.</p></div><div><br></div><div>Refer this for more generic Information: <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier" class="" title="">UUID WIKI INFO</a></strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>How unique is UUID ?</strong></div><div>---------------------------------</div><div><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1155008/how-unique-is-uuid" class="" title=""><strong>REFER STACKOVERFLOW Expert's ANSWER</strong></a></div><div><br></div><div><b>UUID Algorithm Analysis</b></div><div>---------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Most of the time, many things need to be shared but should be unique enough to be confined within a sender and a receiver. All of the social networking and sharing sites need to have a unique URI/URN which ensures privacy to the user. UUID is what emerges to compliant with that very huge need to generate an all-time UNIQUE string.</div><div>Dropbox, Google drive, Evernote, Microsoft and many other big and small organizations are using it(derived their own versions).</div><div><br></div><div>Full Official Specification&nbsp;<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4122.html" class="" title=""><b>RFC4122 UUID Reference</b></a><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><span></span></div><div><br></div><div>The idea behind the scene is to generate a uniquely identified string is based on the very known thing is to first find the things which are always changing example: Time and which relatively differs example: MAC Address and on-the-fly generated random strings. All these stuff combined under one hood with much more security related things ensures HOW UNIQUE IS UUID.</div><div><br></div><div><b>UUID has Variant and Versions:</b></div><div>-------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Version 1</u></b> is the time based plus MAC address UUID. The 128-bits contains 48-bits for the network card's MAC address (which is uniquely assigned by the manufacturer) and a 60-bit clock with a resolution of 100 nanoseconds. That clock wraps in 3603 A.D. so these UUIDs are safe at least until then (unless you need more than 10 million new UUIDs per second or someone clones your network card). I say "at least" because the clock starts at 15 October 1582, so you have about 400 years after the clock wraps before there is even a small possibility of duplications.</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Version 4</u></b> is the random number UUID. There's six fixed bits and the rest of the UUID is 122-bits of randomness. See Wikipedia or other analysis that describe how very unlikely a duplicate is.</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Version 3</u></b> is uses MD5 and Version 5 uses SHA-1 to create those 122-bits, instead of a random or pseudo-random number generator. So in terms of safety it is like Version 4 being a statistical issue (as long as you make sure what the digest algorithm is processing is always unique).</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Version 2</u></b> is similar to Version 1, but with a smaller clock so it is going to wrap around much sooner. But since Version 2 UUIDs are for DCE, you shouldn't be using these.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
