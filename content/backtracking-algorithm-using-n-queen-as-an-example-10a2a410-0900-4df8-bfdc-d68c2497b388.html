Further solution using deteminant was provided by S. Gunter . </span></p><p><span>But these algorithms were not efficient for O(N) time. Edgser Dijkstra solved this problem very efficiently using Depth-first Backtrack Algorithm .</span></p><p><b><br><span></span></b></p><h1><b><span>How the Backtrack Algorithm works ?</span></b></h1><p><b><span>Backtrack algorithm </span><span>uses recursion heavily and based on it.</span></b></p><p><b><span>* Each recursive call attempts to place queen in a column . </span></b></p><p><b><span>* For a given call state of boards is known in that recursive </span></b></p><p><b><span>* If the current placement of queen does not lead to a solution.

A simple quick sort algorithm has evolved through decade of sorting algorithms . Backtracing for N Queens &nbsp;Algorithm evolved through a decade . So a lot brain storm might have helped to find a solution .</span></p><p><span>Mathematician helped them to think in algebra concepts but Backtracking is Computer derivative of Recursion . </span></p><p><span>Recursion might have struck Dijkstra while doing some recursion problem and finding that N-Queen can solved using it because one is passing previous results into the next recursion call if it satisfies a condition then keep proceeding . If it fails backtrack to previous call and rectify it .</span></p><p><span>So recursion in itself is not backtracking . But Dijkstra might have thought it as during thought process to save the state and jump back to previous state and correct that state. </span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>Moreover It can be thought as an analogy to nature rule of destroying what is wrong and start over from correct end. Analogy of joining the correct threads. </span></p><p><br><span></span><br><span></span></p><h1><span>How i could have thought of Backtracking Algorithm ?</span></h1><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>First of all i would have tried to solve the problem using chess board . Observing pattern is important to me . I would have started from very basic 8x8 chess board . First find a general solution to it using the following approaches:</span></p><p><span>1.Examplify:</span><span> Taking an example and analysing it.</span></p><p><span>2.Pattern Matching: </span><span>Pattern matching with other problem.</span></p><p><span>3.Simplify and generalise: </span><span>Simplifying the problem into alternative domain like mathematics or physics.</span></p><p><span>4.Base Case and Build : </span><span>Trying 3x3 then 4x4 and so on</span></p><p><span>5.Data Structure Brainstorm:</span><span> </span><span>Using trees and graphs knowledge and manipulate it in terms of it.</span></p><p><span></span>Which to apply depends on lot of experience in handling the nature of problem . Problem involves artificial intelligence . I would have thought of basic AI techniques and thus might have come to recursion and gave it a thought .&nbsp;</p><p><span></span><span> </span></p><p>I might have used Dynamic programming but yes there will be lots of mistakes and correction while choosing a solution.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h1>Conclusion:</h1><p>A lot of ideas come through experience in handling diversity of problem and also a specific domain helps to handle a problem in different approach . So computer science concepts of recursion helped Dijkstra to explore solution with confidence and make it for N-Queen apart from 8 - Queens.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
