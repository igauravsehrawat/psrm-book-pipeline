It continues to perform a gap insertion sort for each number in the sequence, until it finishes with a gap of 1. When the increment reaches 1, the gap insertion sort is simply an ordinary</span><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" title=""><span> insertion sort</span></a><span>, guaranteeing that the final list is sorted.</span></p></li></ul><span></span><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span>Beginning with large increments allows elements in the file to move quickly towards their final positions, and makes it easier to subsequently sort for smaller increments.</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p><h2><span></span></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><span>Algorithm</span></h2><span></span><p dir="ltr"><span>Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort" title=""><span>comparison sort</span></a><span>. It can either be seen as a generalization of sorting by exchange (</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" title=""><span>bubble sort</span></a><span>) or sorting by insertion (</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" title=""><span>insertion sort</span></a><span>). The method starts by sorting elements far apart from each other and progressively reducing the gap between them. Starting with far apart elements can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, considering every hth element gives a sorted list. Such a list is said to be h-sorted. Equivalently, it can be thought of as h interleaved lists, each individually sorted. Beginning with large values of h, this rearrangement allows elements to move long distances in the original list, reducing large amounts of disorder quickly, and leaving less work for smaller h-sort steps to do. If the file is then k-sorted for some smaller integer k, then the file remains h-sorted. Following this idea for a decreasing sequence of h values ending in 1 is guaranteed to leave a sorted list in the end.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>An example run of Shellsort with gaps 5, 3 and 1 is shown below.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span> </span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Lq2B-gZIM7DKAgjzDuMtZdcn8Ya6UYGU0zHFF-pJMQnitJ9VaCEZb0l_9A5e-xDQESiza74qH8tIWJaDuI5Hldmye9-QQp3koEnehuqRoXz1K4spOOSaXC9OfqUsqw" width="576px;" height="109px;"><span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The first pass, 5-sorting, performs insertion sort on separate subarrays (a</span><span>1</span><span>, a</span><span>6</span><span>, a</span><span>11</span><span>), (a</span><span>2</span><span>, a</span><span>7</span><span>, a</span><span>12</span><span>), (a</span><span>3</span><span>, a</span><span>8</span><span>), (a</span><span>4</span><span>, a</span><span>9</span><span>), (a</span><span>5</span><span>, a</span><span>10</span><span>).
